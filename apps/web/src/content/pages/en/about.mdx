## About Me

I'm a product-minded technologist with a deep love for planning. I'm the go-to planner in every group: organizing the trip, hosting the event, helping friends redecorate their rooms "just because it could flow better." On top of that, I make lists for everything—daily to-dos, travel plans, gift ideas (yes, even if your birthday is ten months away), even future cat names. Can you tell I'm type A yet?

This organized mindset is also fundamental to how I approach technology and product development. With experience across AI and frontend development, I've led significant projects at Morgan Stanley, including frontend development for AI@MS+, a generative AI platform that empowered 80,000+ employees to build their own GPTs. By applying systematic planning and thoughtful design, we transformed the development process, cutting creation time from months to minutes. I also helped scale the Morgan Stanley at Work and E*Trade virtual assistants, serving nearly 9 million users across platforms, while spearheading accessibility efforts.

I want every version to be better than the last because products should be iterated with intention—just like my meticulously organized plans. To me, great products don't try to be perfect on day one—they evolve with their users. I build with that in mind: prioritizing what matters, launching thoughtfully, and always staying open to feedback.
