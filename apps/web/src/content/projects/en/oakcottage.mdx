## Overview

Oak Cottage is a short-term rental property located in OKC, catering to various needs including day leadership meetings, intimate gatherings, and small special event celebrations. The website serves as the primary online presence for the property, providing information about the space, amenities, pricing, and booking options.

The goal was to create a clean, visually appealing site that quickly conveys the possibilities offered by the venue and makes it easy for potential guests to explore the gallery, get in touch, or book their stay online.
