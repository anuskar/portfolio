## The Problem: News Doesn't Have to Be Exhausting

Most news platforms focus on conflict, disasters, and negativity. In a world often bombarded with polarizing and depressing stories designed to drive views, staying informed can feel stressful and draining, leading many to avoid the news altogether. My goal with GoodNews was simple: what if staying updated could feel hopeful instead?

## What I Built

GoodNews is a web app designed as a refreshing take on the daily news cycle. It uses AI to find and share uplifting stories, focusing on progress, solutions, and positive eventsâ€”like breakthroughs in technology and healthcare, or useful productivity tips. It aims to complement your usual news consumption with a dose of positivity and balance the emotional scale.

**Key Features:**

- **Curated Homepage:** Features the most impactful positive news (`MainStory`), a feed of the latest uplifting articles (`NewStories`), and trending positive content (`TrendingStories`).
- **Focused Topics:** The `NewsByTopic` section allows users to explore articles based on specific areas of interest (with plans to expand customization).
- **Personalization (Planned):** An upcoming `Account Tab` will allow users to select and modify topic preferences for a tailored feed.
- **AI-Powered Filtering:** Leverages sentiment analysis to ensure only positive news reaches the platform.

**Homepage Example (Main & New Stories)**

## How It Works

The application retrieves articles from various reputable sources. Our backend, built with Python (Flask) and MongoDB, processes these articles:

1.  **AI Sentiment Analysis:** Each article is evaluated using OpenAI's GPT models. Only those with a positive sentiment score are kept.
2.  **Indexing for Relevance:** Positive articles are indexed using FAISS for efficient similarity searching based on content and positivity.
3.  **Delivery via API:** React frontend fetches curated news via dedicated endpoints:
    - `/getLatest`: Delivers the newest positive stories.
    - `/getMostRelevant`: Provides stories sorted by positive sentiment score.
    - `/getMostRelevant_byQuery`: Allows searching for positive news on specific topics.

## Behind the Scenes

Building GoodNews involved integrating several technologies:

- **Frontend:** React for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Python (Flask) to handle logic and API requests, with CORS support.
- **Database:** MongoDB to store and manage news articles.
- **AI & Search:** OpenAI GPT models for sentiment analysis and FAISS for efficient vector similarity search.

A key technical challenge was refining the sentiment analysis to accurately filter for genuinely positive content while excluding superficially positive but ultimately negative or sensational stories. The focus remains on delivering meaningful, uplifting news.

## What I Learned (In Progress)

Developing GoodNews highlighted several key insights:

- **The Need for Positivity:** There's a strong desire for news experiences that don't contribute to stress and anxiety.
- **AI's Role in Curation:** Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for filtering content, but requires careful tuning.
- **Personalization is Key:** Users value the ability to tailor content to their specific interests (reinforcing the plan for the Account Tab).

## Results (Projected)

While formal user testing metrics are forthcoming, the goal is to achieve:

- Reduced news-related stress for users.
- Increased engagement with positive content compared to traditional news sources.
- Demonstrate the viability of a positivity-focused news platform.

## Next Steps

Our roadmap focuses on enhancing the user experience and the quality of curation:

- **Implement User Personalization:** Launch the `Account Tab` allowing users to select topics they care about.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Incorporate more sophisticated ML models to improve sentiment analysis accuracy and personalization relevance.
- **Expand Content Sources:** Integrate a wider variety of reputable sources for diverse positive news.

We aim to make GoodNews an indispensable part of a balanced daily news routine.
